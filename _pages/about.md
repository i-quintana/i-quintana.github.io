Hello! My name is Ignacio and I am a mechanical engineer with a focus on mechatronics and control systems, applying for PhD programs in the United States. My interests lie in the modeling, control, and coordination of complex dynamical systems, with particular motivation drawn from aerospace and autonomous systems.

I have experience spanning experimental work, system-level modeling, and data-driven analysis through academic projects and industry internships. I am particularly interested in research at the intersection of control theory, learning-based methods, and real-world validation.

You can find my CV [here](/files/CV%20-%20Quintana.pdf.pdf).
