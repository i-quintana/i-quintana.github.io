This project involved the design and experimental validation of a thermocouple-based temperature measurement system, with focus on accurate sensing, signal conditioning, and calibration.

**Problem Statement**  
Thermocouples provide robust temperature measurements across wide operating ranges, but require careful signal conditioning and calibration to mitigate noise, offset, and nonlinearity. The objective was to design a reliable measurement chain capable of delivering accurate temperature estimates under realistic experimental conditions.

**Approach**  
I designed and implemented a complete thermocouple measurement system, including:
- Selection of appropriate thermocouple type based on operating range and sensitivity  
- Cold-junction compensation strategy  
- Analog signal conditioning and amplification  
- Data acquisition and digital processing  

Calibration procedures were developed using reference temperature sources, and experimental data were compared against theoretical thermocouple response curves.

**Validation**  
System performance was evaluated through repeatability tests and error analysis. Measurement uncertainty was quantified by accounting for sensor tolerances, amplifier noise, and calibration residuals.

**Relevance**  
This project strengthened my interest in experimental systems where sensing, modeling, and uncertainty directly impact system-level performance, and informs my current focus on control and estimation problems in physical systems.
