This project focused on the design and validation of an actively actuated airbrake system to regulate the apogee of a sounding rocket by modulating aerodynamic drag during ascent.

**Problem Statement**  
Sounding rockets are highly sensitive to variations in mass, thrust, and atmospheric conditions, leading to significant dispersion in apogee. The objective was to design an airbrake mechanism capable of reducing this dispersion through controlled drag modulation.

**Approach**  
I led the mechanical design of a deployable airbrake system constrained by mass, volume, and structural requirements. The work included:
- Conceptual and detailed CAD design of the airbrake mechanism  
- Aerodynamic modeling to estimate drag contribution as a function of deployment angle  
- Structural analysis to ensure survivability under aerodynamic and inertial loads  
- Integration considerations with onboard avionics and actuation systems  

**Validation**  
The system was validated through a combination of numerical simulations and ground testing, focusing on deployment repeatability, structural integrity, and aerodynamic effectiveness.

**Relevance**  
This project reflects my interest in aerospace systems where mechanical design, dynamics, and control interact under real-world constraints, and motivated my further focus on guidance and control problems in aerospace applications.
